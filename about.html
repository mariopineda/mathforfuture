<p>The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated that the balance of evidence suggests a human influence on global climate. The aim of this web site is to increases climate literacy among young people by incorporating high school mathematics into a socially meaningful context focusing on the role humans have on the environmental. Using the best avaliable scientific information. Today's youth are the leaders and voters of the future.</p>

At present, many young people are demonstrating persistently for climate protection and the preservation of our natural resources. The concerns of many young people are justified and supported by the best available science. The current measures for protecting the climate, biodiversity, and forest, marine, and soil resources, are far from sufficient.

The enormous mobilisation of the “Fridays for Future“ movement shows that young people have understood the situation. As for the rest of us, we can only emphatically underline their demand for rapid and consistent action.

While the need for participation and discussion remains, action must be taken now.
