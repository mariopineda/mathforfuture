<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p>This website is a curated repository of high school math problems aligned with the Alberta Education program of Study for grade 10-12 mathematics. The primary purpose of this web site is to provide extra practice problems for my students. This site is made available to be freely used by students, teachers and members of the public.</p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h2>Who made this web site?</h2?
<p>I am an Edmonton-based high school math teacher.</p>

<h2>I found an mistake in a question or solution</h2>
<p>Thank you for finding it. You can report the error using the "Report Errors" link on the bottom of the page where the practice problem is.</p>

<h2>Why is a question missing a solution?</h2>
<p>This site is permanently under construction and the development of the practice problems is an ongoing "one man show". Sometimes I fall behind a bit. Rest assure that I am always working on new practice problems and solutions as fast as I can. Check back regularly for new problems and solution.</p>
