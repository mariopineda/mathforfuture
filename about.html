<h1>{{ page.title }} - Open Math for a Changing Future</h1>

<p>This website is a curated repository of high school math problems aligned with the Alberta Education program of Study for grade 10-12 mathematics. The primary purpose of this web site is for me to use it with my own students, but it is also an experiment in 'open source' math education which means that it is publicly avaliable for anyone else to use as well.</p>

  <p>Warming stripes for 1850 (left side of graphic) to 2018 (right side of graphic). Progression from blue (cooler) to red (warmer) annual readings indicates long-term increase of average global temperature.
