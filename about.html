Teachers have a moral obligation to “tell it like it is” by basing the education of their students on facts supported by scientific evidence. On the basis of this obligation this resource is based on the clear and unequivocal scientific evidence that planet Earth is facing a climate emergency. The aim of this web site is to use the best possible scientific evidence to improve student understand and engage the next generation of Canadians and global citizens on the critical issue of climate change. The present and future citizens of any democratic country will face climate change. This will demand a basic level of scientific literacy to rational thinking of science in relation to personal, social, political and economic challenges. ( Wayne’s & Nicholas, Hurd). Climate change is a global issue with ramification in the personal, social, political and economic sphere of our life.

<p>The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated that the balance of evidence suggests a human
influence on global climate. The socially relevant evidence-based online high school math resource. The aim of this web page is to increases “climate literacy” among young people by incorporate mathematics as an essential element of the global response to climate change. It helps students understand and address the impact of global warming encouraing schanges in their attitudes and behaviour, and helps them critically evaluate climate change information they come across.</p>
