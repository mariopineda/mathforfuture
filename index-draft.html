    <p><em>Welcome to Math For Future,</em></p>
    <p>This website is a collection of high school math practice problems aligned with the <a href="https://education.alberta.ca/mathematics-10-12/programs-of-study/">Alberta Education High School Program of Study in Mathematics</a>.</p>

    <p>Due to recent the school closure caused by the COVID-19 pandemic I have made this website avaliable to the general public and in particular high school students in Alberta. My hope is that this resource might be helpful  to students as they are finishing their school from home and to prepare them for the next grade level. </p>

    <p>May the math be with you,</p>
    <p>Dr. P.</p>
