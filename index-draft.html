    <p><em>Welcome to Math For Future,</em></p>
    <p>This web site is a collection of high school math practice problems aligned with the Alberta Education High School Program of Study in Mathematics.</p>

    <p>Due to recent the school closure caused by the COVID-19 pandemic I have made this web site avaliable to the general public and in particular high school students in Alberta. My hope is that this resource might be helpful  to high school students or students finishing up grade 9 and who wish to get prepared for grade 10.</p>

    <p>I am a high school teacher in Alberta and because this is a "one man show" this site is permanently under construction. My focus during the school closures will be on developing and curating math practic problems with complete solutions for Math 10C. Time permitting I may add the occasional practice problem for Math 20-2 and 30-2.</p>

    <p>May the math be with you,</p>
    <p>Dr. P.</p>
