    <p><em>Welcome to Math For Future,</em></p>
    <p>This web page is a collection of high school math practice problems aligned with Alberta curriculum for grade 10-12 math.</p>

    <p>Due to recent the school closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic I have made this page avaliable to the general public and in particular high school students in Alberta. My hope is that this resource might be helpful for to highschool students or students finishing up grade 9 and who wish to get prepared for grade 10.</p>

    <p>I am a high school teacher in Alberta and because this is a "one man show" my  focus during the school closures will be on developing and curating math practic problems with complete solutions for Math 10C. Time permitting I may add the occasional practice problem for grade 11 and 12 classes as well (Math 20-2 and 30-2), but there are no guarantees.</p>
