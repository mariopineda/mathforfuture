  <h1>Welcome to Math for Future</h1>

  <p>Welcome to Math For Future,</p>
  <p>This web page is a collection of high school math practice problems aligned with Alberta curriculum for grade 10-12 math.</p>

  <p>Due to recent the school closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic I have made this page avaliable to the general public and in particular high school students in Alberta.</p>

  <p>I am a high school teacher in Alberta and because this is a "one man show" my  focus during the school closures will be on developing and curating math practic problems with complete solutions for Math 10C. Time permitting I may add the occasional practice problem for grade 11 and 12 classes as well (Math 20-2 and 30-2), but there are no guarantees.</p>
