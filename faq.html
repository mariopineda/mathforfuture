      <p>My focus during the school closures will be on developing and curating math practic problems with complete solutions for Math 10C. Time permitting I may add the occasional practice problem for Math 20-2 and 30-2. The reason for this is, firsly, because I am using these practice problems with my current 10C students and secondly, my own teenager is going into grade 10 next year, so many of the practice problems have been developed specifically to help him and his friends prepare for the next school year.</p>

      <p>This site is permanently under construction and the development of the practice problems is an ongoing "one man show" and sometimes I fall behind a bit. Rest assure that I am always working on new practice problems and solutions as fast as I can. Check back again and new problems and solution will have been posted.</p>
