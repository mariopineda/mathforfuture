<p>Solve the following problems by creating an equation and solving it for the unknown variable. {% include_relative modal.html content="Choose a variable to represent the quantity you are looking for. Express the described context as an equation using your variable. Solve for the unknown variable." %}
<ol type="A">
  <li>A regular polygon has a perimeter of 34.08 cm and a side length of 5.68 cm. How many sides does the polygon have?</li>
  <li>One year, a student council sold 856 copies of a school yearbook. Four fifths of the students at the school bought a copy. How many students did not buy a yearbook.</li>
  <li>A score of 17 on a math test results in a mark of 68%. What score would give you a mark of 100%?</li>
  <li>The area of Nunavut is about $4\fraction{3}{8}$ times the area of the Yukon Territory. Nunavut covers 21% of Canada’s area. What percent of Canada’s area does the Yukon Territory cover?</li>
  <li>I am thinking of a number. When you multiply the number by 5 and then add 14, you get the same result as when you add 10 to the number I am thinking of and then multiply the result by 2. What number am I thinking about?</li>
</ol>

<h3>A.</h3>
<p>$x = $ number of sides in polygon.</p>
<p>side length $\times$ number of sides $=$ perimeter</p>
<p>$5.68x=34.08$</p>
\[
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    5.68x & = & 34.08 \\
    x & = & \fraction{34.08}{5.68} \\
    x & = & 6
  \end{array}
\]
<p>The polygon has 6 sides (hexagon).</p>
