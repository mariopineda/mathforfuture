<p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a virus and is the cause of the 2020 coronavirus outbreak. It is primarily spread between people via respiratory droplets from infected individuals when they cough or sneeze. Time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally between 2 and 14 days. Spread can be limited by handwashing and other hygiene measures. The number of infected people during the first five weeks of the 2020 outbreak can be modelled with the following exponential function $I(d) = 282 (1.165)^d$ where $d$ represents the number of days since January 19 (starting with $d=0$ on January 19, 2020) and $I(d)$ represents the number of diagnosed infected people.</p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>How many people were infected on January 19?</li>
  <li>What is the daily growth rate? Explain.</li>
  <li>How many people were infected on February 23 (January has 31 days)?</li>
  <li>How long did it take, to the nearest day, for 10000 people to become infected?</li>
</ol>
