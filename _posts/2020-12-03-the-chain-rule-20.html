<p>Given $f(x)=(2x+1)^5 (x^3-x+1)^4$;
<ol type="A">
  <li>Sketch $f(x)$. Use <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator" target="_blank">Desmos</a> to help you visualize the graph before sketching.</li>
  <li>Predict $f'(x)$ by superimposing a sketch of it onto the sketch of $f(x)$.</li>
  <li>Differentiate $f(x)$. Answer in fully factored form. {% include_relative hint-modal1.html content="Use the Product Rule before using the Chain Rule." %}</li>
  <li>Graph $f'(x)$ in <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator" target="_blank">Desmos</a> by superimposing it onto the graph of $f(x)$. Was your predicted skecth of $f'(x)$ in (B) correct?</li>
</ol>
