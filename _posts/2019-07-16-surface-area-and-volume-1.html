<p>The Trans Mountain Pipeline starts at the Edmonton Terminal located between Sherwood Park and Edmonton. Twenty feeder pipelines from throughout Alberta arrive at the terminal. The terminal has 20 large cylindrical storage tanks for temporarily storing oil before it is sent to its other destination, e.g. to the United States or to shipping terminals in BC. </p>

<ol>
  <li>Using the vehicle in front of the tank as a referent estimate the height of the tank to the nearest metre. Assume the vehicle is 1.5 metres high at its highest point.</li>
  <li>The storage tanks are cylindrical in shape painted white and with the roof covered in gravel or metal sheeting. Determine the surface area of a storage tanks if its diamater is 50 m. Round your answer to the nearest metre.</li>
  <li>Determine the amount of paint required to paint all the storage tanks in the satellite picture. Assume all the tanks have the same surface area. Each tank needs to be painted with two coats of white colour. On litre paint has a coverage of 100 m$^2$.</li>
</ol>

        <h3>A.</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>The area of the yard that Sparky has access to is a circle with a 8 ft radius. The area of this circle is $A=\pi r^2 = \pi 8^2=201.06...$ ft$^2$.</li>
            <li>Each package of seed covers 50 ft$^2$ so the number of packages required to seed the damaged area is $\frac{\displaystyle 201.06...}{\displaystyle 50} = 4.02... \approx 4$ packages. Alternativelly, since we need slightly more than 4 packages we could round up to 5 packages.</li>
            <li>Each package costs \$2.50 so the total cost of $4.02...$ packages will be $2.50 \times 4.02...=10.05...\approx 10$ dollars. If we rounded the number of packages up to 5 then the cost would be $2.50 \times 5 = 12.50$ dollars. Either answer is acceptable as long as your reasoning is explained.</li>
            <li>A cat would never ruin your lawn.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>B.</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The formula for calculating the suface area of a cube is $SA=6x^2$, since we know $SA=70$ cm$^2$ we can calculate the side length of the cube by substituting in the surface area and solve for $x$, $70=6x^2 \Rightarrow \frac{\displaystyle 70}{\displaystyle 6} = x^2 \Rightarrow x = \sqrt{\frac{\displaystyle 70}{\displaystyle 6}} \Rightarrow x = 3.41...$ cm</li>
          <li>The formula for calculating the volume of a cube is $V=x^3$. We subsitute in the side length, $V=3.41...^3=39.84... \approx 39.9$ cm$^3$.
