<p>A high school student having a summer job as a sales person at a bicycle store is paid a monthly salary of &dollar;2080 plus 5% commission on monthly sales.The function that represents her monthly earnings is $E(s) = 2080 + 0.05s$.</p>

<ol type="A">
  <li>State what the variables $E$ and $s$ represent.</li>
  <li>Determine the value of $E(4500)$ and explain its meaning.</li>
  <li>Determine the value of $s$ for $E(s)=3500$ and explain its meaning.</li>
  <li>Determine the value of $E(0)$ and explain its meaning.</li>
  <li>Determine the hourly wage assuming the youth works 40 hours per week.</li>
  <li>In June 2019 the newly elected Alberta government rolled back the minimum youth wage to the amount calculated in the previous question. Before the roll back the minimum youth wage was $15/hour. How would the function representing the monthly earnings change?
