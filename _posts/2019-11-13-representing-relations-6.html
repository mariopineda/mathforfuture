<p>In 2015 the provincial government in Alberta increased the minimum wage for students under 18 to \$15 /hour. In 2019 the newly elected provincial government rolled back the minimum salary to \$13 /hour. </p>

<h3>A.</h3>
<p>State the independent and dependent variables.</p>

<h3>B.</h3>
<p>Express the relations between the number of hours worked, $h$, and total earnings, $E$, for the $15 /hour minimum wage as an equation.</p>

<h3>C.</h3>
<p>Express the relations between the number of hours worked, $h$, and total earnings, $E$, for the $13 /hour minimum wage as an equation.</p>

<h3>D</dfn>.</h3>
<p>Using <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator
">Desmos</a>, graph the relations (on the same graph using two colours, one for each equation) for a 40 hour work week. Label the axes and adjust the domain and the range to realistic values for this context.{% include_relative hint-modal.html content="To set the domain and range in Desmos you will need to define a restriction for each graphed function. <a href='https://learn.desmos.com/restrictions' target='_blank'>Learn more about restrictions in Desmos</a>." %}</p>

<h3>C.</h3>
<p>Should the data values be joined by a continuous line? Explain your answer.</p>

<h3>D.</h3>
<p>What would your earnings be for an 40 hour work week under the two pay rates?</p>

<h3>E.</h3>
<p>What is the difference in earnings between the two pay rates? How much less would you earn after a week after the roll back?</p>

<h3>F.</h3>
<p>How many hours would you have to work to earn $1000 under the two pay rates?</p>
