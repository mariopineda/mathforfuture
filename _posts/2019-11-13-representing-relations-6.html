<p>In 2015 the provincial government in Alberta increased the minimum wage for students under 18 to 15 dollars/hour. In 2019 the newly elected provincial government rolled back the minimum salary to 13 dollars/hour. </p>

<h3>A.</h3>
<p>Express these relations using equations, where $E$ represent total earnings and $h$ represents the number of hours worked.</p>

<h3>B.</h3>
<p>Graph the relations (on the same graph using two colours, one for each equation) for a 40 hour work week. Give the graph a title and label the axes. State the independent and dependent variables.</p>

<h3>C.</h3>
<p>Should the data values be joined by a continuous line? Explain your answer.</p>

<h3>D.</h3>
<p>What would your earnings be for an 40 hour work week under the two pay rates?</p>

<h3>E.</h3>
<p>What is the difference in earnings between the two pay rates? How much less would you earn after a week after the roll back?</p>

<h3>F.</h3>
<p>How many hours would you have to work to earn $1000 under the two pay rates?</p>
