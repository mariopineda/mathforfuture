<p>In 2015 the provincial government in Alberta increased the minimum wage for students under 18 to $15 dollars/hour. In 2019 the newly elected provincial government rolled back the minimum salary to $13 dollars/hour. </p>

<ol type="A">
  <li>Express these relations using equations, where $E$ represent total earnings and $h$ represents the number of hours worked.</li>
  <li>Graph the relations (on the same graph using two colours, one for each equation) for a 40 hour work week. Give the graph a title and label the axes. State the independent and dependent variables.</li>
  <li>Should the data values be joined by a continuous line? Explain your answer.</li>
  <li>What would your earnings be for an 40 hour work week under the two pay rates?</li>
  <li>What is the difference in earnings between the two pay rates? How much less would you earn after a week after the roll back?</li>
  <li>How many hours would you have to work to earn $1000 under the two pay rates?</li>
</ol>
