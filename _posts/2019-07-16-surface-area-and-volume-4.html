<p>A manufacturer is designing a new cylindrial paint can with a diameter of 20 cm. She plans to use 2200 cm$^2$ of material to make the can. What is the height of the can, to the nearest whole centimetre that uses all avaliable material?</p>

{% capture solution %}
$r = \fraction{20}{2} = 10$ cm
<p>
  $$
    \begin{array}{rcl}
       SA & = & 2 \pi r^2 + 2 \pi r h & \\
     2200 & = & 2\pi(10)^2 + 2 \pi (10) h \\
     2200 & = & 628.32 \dots + 20 \pi h \\
     1571.68 \ldots & = & 20 \pi h \\
     h & = & \fraction{1571.68}{20 \pi} \\
     h & = & 25.0 \mbox{cm}    
    \end{array}
  $$
