<p>Draw and label the Unit Circle, each quadrant should include three exact angles measures in radians with the corresponding exact coordinates. {% include_relative hint-modal1.html content="Note that the Unit Circle we sketched in class has an error. Can you find it?" %} Use your Unit Circle to evaluate exactly $\cos^2 \left( \fraction{\pi}{6} \right) -2\tan \fraction{9\pi}{4} + 3\sin(-7\pi)$. </p>
